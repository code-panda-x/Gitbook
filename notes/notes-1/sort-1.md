# Sort



* In Java, Arrays.sort() for primitives is implemented using a variant of the Quick Sort algorithm, which has a space complexity of O(Nlogn)
* In C++, the sort() function provided by STL uses a hybrid of Quick Sort, Heap Sort and Insertion Sort, with a worst case space complexity of O(Nlogn)
* In Python, the sort() function is implemented using the Timsort algorithm, which has a worst-case space complexity of O(Nlogn)
