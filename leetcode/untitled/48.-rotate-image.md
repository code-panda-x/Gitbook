# 48. Rotate Image

{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/discuss/18872/A-common-method-to-rotate-the-image" %}

My intuition was rotating a matrix made all the rows columns and vice versa. What is the natural mathematical operation that does this? It is the transpose, after making our rows columns it is now a question of rearranging them properly. So when faced with questions like this first take the transpose and then think how you can rearrange the rows/columns to get to your final answer

取target matrix的tranpose，拿original matrix比较，反推第一步需要进行的操作

```
class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[][] matrix) {
        int l = 0;
        int r = matrix.length - 1;
        
        while(l < r)
        {
            int temp [] = matrix[l];
            matrix[l] = matrix[r];
            matrix[r] = temp;
            l++;
            r--;
        }
        
        for(int i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++)
        {
            for(int j = 0; j < i; j++)
            {
                int temp = matrix[i][j];
                matrix[i][j] = matrix[j][i];
                matrix[j][i] = temp;
            }
        }
    }
}


```
