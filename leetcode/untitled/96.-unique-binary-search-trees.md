# 96. Unique Binary Search Trees

Why it works:

First note that dp\[k] represents the number of BST trees built from 1....k;

Then assume we have the number of the first 4 trees: dp\[1] = 1 ,dp\[2] =2 ,dp\[3] = 5, dp\[4] =14 , how do we get dp\[5] based on these four numbers is the core problem here.

The essential process is: to build a tree, we need to pick a root node, then we need to know how many possible left sub trees and right sub trees can be held under that node, finally multiply them.

To build a tree contains {1,2,3,4,5}. First we pick 1 as root, for the left sub tree, there are none; for the right sub tree, we need count how many possible trees are there constructed from {2,3,4,5}, apparently it's the same number as {1,2,3,4}. So the total number of trees under "1" picked as root is dp\[0] \* dp\[4] = 14. (assume dp\[0] =1). Similarly, root 2 has dp\[1]\*dp\[3] = 5 trees. root 3 has dp\[2]\*dp\[2] = 4, root 4 has dp\[3]\*dp\[1]= 5 and root 5 has dp\[0]\*dp\[4] = 14. Finally sum the up and it's done.

Now, we may have a better understanding of the dp\[k], which essentially represents the number of BST trees with k consecutive nodes. It is used as database when we need to know how many left sub trees are possible for k nodes when picking (k+1) as root.



How it works:

```
/*    
Hope it will help you to understand :
    
    n = 0;     null   
    
    count[0] = 1
    
    
    n = 1;      1       
    
    count[1] = 1 
    
    
    n = 2;    1__       			 __2     
    		      \					/                 
    		     count[1]	   	count[1]	
    
    count[2] = 1 + 1 = 2
    
    
    
    n = 3;    
    count[3] = count[2] x count[0] + count[1] x count[1] + count[0] x count[2]
    
    count[3] = 2 + 1 + 2  = 5
    
    
    
    n = 4;    1__  					__2__					   ___3___                  
    		      \				 /        \					  /		  \			
    		  count[3]		 count[1]    count[2]		  count[2]   count[1]
    
                 __4				
               /
           count[3]   
    
    count[4] = 5 + 2 + 2 + 5 = 14     
    

And  so on...

 public int numTrees(int n) {
    int [] dp = new int[n+1];
    dp[0]= 1;
    dp[1] = 1;
    for(int level = 2; level <=n; level++)
        for(int root = 1; root<=level; root++)
            dp[level] += dp[level-root]*dp[root-1];
