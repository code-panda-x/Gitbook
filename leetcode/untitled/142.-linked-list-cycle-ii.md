# 142. Linked List Cycle II

感觉没太多说的，只是一个证明，用就行了

证明：

When fast and slow meet at point p, the length they have run are 'a+2b+c' and 'a+b'.\
Since the fast is 2 times faster than the slow. So a+2b+c == 2(a+b), then we get 'a==c'.\
So when another slow2 pointer run from head to 'q', at the same time, previous slow pointer will run from 'p' to 'q', so they meet at the pointer 'q' together.\
