# 84. Largest Rectangle in Histogram

The meaning of `r` and `l` is somewhat confusing, to put them more accurately:\
`l`: the **first** coordinate of the bar to the **left** with height h\[l] **<** h\[i].\
`r`: the **first** coordinate of the bar to the **right** with height h\[r] < h\[i].\

TLE

```
class Solution {
    public int largestRectangleArea(int[] heights) {
        int answer = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < heights.length; i++){
            int currentHeight = heights[i];
            int left = i, right = i;
            while(left >= 0 && heights[left] >= currentHeight) left--;
            while(right < heights.length && heights[right] >= currentHeight) right++;
            answer = Math.max(answer,((right -1) - (left + 1) + 1 )*currentHeight );
            
        }
        
        return answer;
    }
}

God like line

    if (height == null || height.length == 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    lessFromLeft[0] = -1;

    for (int i = 1; i < height.length; i++) {
        int p = i - 1;

        while (p >= 0 && height[p] >= height[i]) {
            p = lessFromLeft[p];
        }

    }

    int maxArea = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < height.length; i++) {
        maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, height[i] * (lessFromRight[i] - lessFromLeft[i] - 1));
    }

Here's the intuition to understand p = lessFromLeft[p]; :

Consider the test case
indices.......... : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
heights.......... : 4 9 8 7 6 5 9 8 7 6 5 4.
lessFromLeft :     -1 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 . .

In this, when we reach 5 at index 10, we start searching for idx=9, i.e. p points at 6.
6 > 5.
Now, we want something which is smaller than 5, so it should definitely be smaller than 6. So 6 says to 5:

I've already done the effort to find the nearest number that's smaller than me and you needn't traverse the array again till that point. My lessFromLeft points at index 5 and all the elements between that and me are greater than me so they are surely greater than you. So just jump to that index and start searching from there.

So you next p directly points at idx = 5, at value 5.

There, this 5 again says the same statement to current 5 and asks it to jump directly to idx = 0. So in the second iteration itself, our search has reached idx=0 and that's our answer for the current element.

Similarly, for the next element 4, it'll take 3 steps.

And for all the elements following 4, if they are greater than 4, their search will stop at 4 itself.

Bottomline: we are not traversing the array again and again. it's O(n).
