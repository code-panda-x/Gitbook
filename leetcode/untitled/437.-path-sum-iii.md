# 437. Path Sum III

Java DFS

the question is how many paths that sums to target inside the binary tree rooted by **root**\
then the answer includes three parts:

* how many path that started from **root**, then we can use **pathSumFrom** to get it
* how many path insides the tree rooted by **root->left**, so we just pass root->left to **pathSum**
* how many path insides the tree rooted by **root->right**

inside means the path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf



pathSumFrom means pathSum starting at that node while pathSum means the sum inside the binary tree lead by that node. If only pathSumFrom is called then it would only return number of paths starting at the root.

```
public class Solution {
    public int pathSum(TreeNode root, int sum) {
        if (root == null) return 0;
        return pathSumFrom(root, sum) + pathSum(root.left, sum) + pathSum(root.right, sum);
    }
    
    private int pathSumFrom(TreeNode node, int sum) {
        if (node == null) return 0;
        return (node.val == sum ? 1 : 0) 
            + pathSumFrom(node.left, sum - node.val) + pathSumFrom(node.right, sum - node.val);
    }
}

Time:
For each node, three searches are needed, and the time cost for each search is the height of the tree, that's O(h). 
The worst case, Tree is like Linked List, h == n, O(h) = O(n); 
Best case, Tree is Balanced, which means height == logn, O(h) == O(logn);
Since the number of nodes is n, for each node search is O(h) =>
best case: O(nlogn)
worst case: O(nn)

Space:
O(N)
```
