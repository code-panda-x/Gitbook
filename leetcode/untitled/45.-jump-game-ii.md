# 45. Jump Game II

The main idea is based on greedy. Let's say the range of the current jump is \[curBegin, curEnd], curFarthest is the farthest point that all points in \[curBegin, curEnd] can reach. Once the current point reaches curEnd, then trigger another jump, and set the new curEnd with curFarthest, then keep the above steps, as the following:



This is an implicit bfs solution. i == curEnd means you visited all the items on the current level. Incrementing jumps++ is like incrementing the level you are on. And curEnd = curFarthest is like getting the queue size (level size) for the next level you are traversing.





```
class Solution {
    public int jump(int[] nums) {
        int jumps = 0, currentJumpEnd = 0, farthest = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
            // we continuously find the how far we can reach in the current jump
            farthest = Math.max(farthest, i + nums[i]);
            // if we have come to the end of the current jump,
            // we need to make another jump
            if (i == currentJumpEnd) {
                jumps++;
                currentJumpEnd = farthest;
            }
        }
        return jumps;
    }
}
```
