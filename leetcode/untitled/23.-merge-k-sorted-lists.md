# 23. Merge k Sorted Lists



Initially when the PQ is created, only first elements of each list is added to PQ, and not the entire linked list.\
Consider the following example:

```
[
1->4->5,
1->3->4,
2->6
]
```

Here , the PQ will have 1,1,2 initially. And each while loop will remove 1 element from the queue using

```
tail.next=queue.poll();
tail=tail.next;
```

However, the key point here is _**the node returned by queue.poll() will still have link to its next node.**_ i.e queue.poll() will return 1 from the PQ and 1 still has a link to next element to 4 in list 1 . Then the below statements will add 4 to priority queue

```
if (tail.next!=null)
queue.add(tail.next);
```

之所以在define PQ的时候用lamda是因为是Listnode需要specify用val比较，不然它不知道用什么比较



in Java, a comparator between two objects o1 and o2 should return 0 if the objects have equal order, a negative number if o2 should come first than o1, and positive if o1 should come after.

When you have a list of integers and you do Sort, the comparator being used is Integer.compare(i1, i2), which returns 0 if i1==i2, a negative number if i1 > i2 and a positive number if i1 < i2

The same for ordering a list of Strings in lexicographic order.

In this problem, we are trying to order ListNode. So we must implement a custom comparator.

(a,b)-> a.val-b.val

It is a lambda function which accesses to the .val of the two ListNode and subtracts them. You can see that it behaves as a comparator, result 0 if they are the same number, negative if ... etc etc...

This solution is actually not good because of Integer overflow. It is better to use Integer.compare() :

```
    PriorityQueue<ListNode> queue= new PriorityQueue<ListNode>(lists.length, (a,b)-> Integer.compare(a.val, b.val));
```

```
class Solution {
    public ListNode mergeKLists(ListNode[] lists) {
        if (lists==null || lists.length==0) return null;
        
        PriorityQueue<ListNode> queue= new PriorityQueue<ListNode>(lists.length, (a,b)-> a.val-b.val);
        
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode tail=dummy;
        
        for (ListNode node:lists)
            if (node!=null)
                queue.add(node);
            
        while (!queue.isEmpty()){
            tail.next=queue.poll();
            tail=tail.next;
            
            if (tail.next!=null)
                queue.add(tail.next);
        }
        return dummy.next;
    }
}

n means the total number of nodes in all lists, so it's still O(n*logk)
For each node, the complexity is O(logk), which is the complexity for adding to the PQ

The space complexity should be O(k) because we are not creating a new linked list and just reconnecting nodes. 
There can be atmost k elements in the heap at any time.
