# 85. Maximal Rectangle

利用84解决

Suppose there're `m` rows, then this question can be considered as `m` histogram questions. And the max solution among the `m` questions is what we want for this problem.

For the example in the description:

```
Input:
[
  ["1","0","1","0","0"],
  ["1","0","1","1","1"],
  ["1","1","1","1","1"],
  ["1","0","0","1","0"]
]
Output: 6
```

there're `4` rows, then we can consider it as `4` histogram questions: `[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]` (for the **first** row), `[2, 0, 2, 1, 1]` (for the first **two** rows), `[3, 1, 3, 2, 2]` (for the first **three** rows) and `[4, 0, 0, 3, 2]` (for the whole **four** rows). (Or concisely, make all rows as y=0 axis, then we will get `4` histogram questions)

Clearly the solution is just the answer for histogram question `[3, 1, 3, 2, 2]`.

```
public int maximalRectangle(char[][] matrix) {
        if(matrix.length==0) return 0;
        // for each cell with value=1, we look upward (north), the number of continuous '1' is the height of cell
        int[] heights = new int[matrix[0].length];
        int maxArea=-1;
        for(int i=0; i<matrix.length; i++){
            for(int j=0; j<matrix[0].length; j++){
                if(matrix[i][j]=='0'){
                    heights[j] = 0;
                } else {
                    heights[j] ++;
                }
            }            
            int area = yourLeetCode84Method(heights);
            maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, area);
        }
        return maxArea;
    }
```
