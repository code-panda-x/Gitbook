# 31. Next Permutation

### https://leetcode.com/media/original\_images/31\_Next\_Permutation.gif

1 3 4 6 5 2&#x20;

swap 4 5&#x20;

1 3 5 6 4 2

reverse 5之后的array（5 之后必然是递减的，因为第一个循环找的就是第一个打破递减的数字）

得1 3 5 2 4 6



I don't know how many guys come up this solution only by himself. At least I cannot, I even don't know what is the next permutation. I stole this solution from somewhere to here because I don't see a clear explanation in LeetCode discussion. I think the biggest problem of this community is people here are too smart. They like writing "short code", they like using annotations like `nums[k] < nums[k + 1]`, they don't like to give example. Even when a problem as abstract as this one.

I don't think any one can understand this solution without seeing an example, here is an example:\
`2,3,6,5,4,1`

Solution:\
Step1, from right to left, find the first number which not increase in a ascending order. In this case which is `3`.\
Step2, here we can have two situations:

1. We cannot find the number, all the numbers increasing in a ascending order. This means this permutation is the last permutation, we need to rotate back to the first permutation. So we reverse the whole array, for example, `6,5,4,3,2,1` we turn it to `1,2,3,4,5,6`.
2. We can find the number, then the next step, we will start from `right most` to leftward, try to find the first number which is larger than `3`, in this case it is `4`.\
   Then we swap `3` and `4`, the list turn to `2,4,6,5,3,1`.\
   Last, we reverse numbers on the right of `4`, we finally get `2,4,1,3,5,6`.

Time complexity is: O(3\*n)=O(n).



```

public void nextPermutation(int[] A) {
    if(A == null || A.length <= 1) return;
    int i = A.length - 2;
    while(i >= 0 && A[i] >= A[i + 1]) i--; // Find 1st id i that breaks descending order
    if(i >= 0) {                           // If not entirely descending
        int j = A.length - 1;              // Start from the end
        while(A[j] <= A[i]) j--;           // Find rightmost first larger id j
        swap(A, i, j);                     // Switch i and j
    }
    reverse(A, i + 1, A.length - 1);       // Reverse the descending sequence
}

public void swap(int[] A, int i, int j) {
    int tmp = A[i];
    A[i] = A[j];
    A[j] = tmp;
}

public void reverse(int[] A, int i, int j) {
    while(i < j) swap(A, i++, j--);
}
```
