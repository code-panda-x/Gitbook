# 88. Merge Sorted Array

Last while loop:

He didn't assume n is bigger than m. Either i or j could have a chance to drop below zero first. But if it's i, noting needed to be done, cause it's already in array nums1.

Last while: All the elements left behind are all less than the rest of the array because its sorted.

```
class Solution {
public:
    void merge(int A[], int m, int B[], int n) {
        int i=m-1;
		int j=n-1;
		int k = m+n-1;
		while(i >=0 && j>=0)
		{
			if(A[i] > B[j])
				A[k--] = A[i--];
			else
				A[k--] = B[j--];
		}
		while(j>=0)
			A[k--] = B[j--];
    }
};

Time: O m+n
Space: O1
```
