# 694. Number of Distinct Islands

Try Input \[\[1,1,0],\[0,1,1],\[0,0,0],\[1,1,1],\[0,1,0]], without sb.append('b') we get "ordr" for both islands, which means we move right, down then right. In order to make them different, we need to also record when we "hit a wall" and return. With sb.append('b'), we now have "ordrbbbb" and "ordbrbbb" representing two different islands.

Since it is DFS, there will be many levels of recursion, you need to know a '1' is to which point's up/down/left/right. I think "o" and "b" are used to bound a specific point in the grid. So the first time you go to a new point, you append "o". Once you finish traversing that point, append "b". You can use this example to see the difference.\
1 1 0\
0 1 1\
0 0 0\
1 1 1\
0 1 0



我们要所有不同的岛屿，以上case两个不同的岛屿的string都是 rdr，所以需要加以区分



```
class Solution {
public int numDistinctIslands(int[][] grid) {
    Set<String> set = new HashSet<>();
    for(int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
        for(int j = 0; j < grid[i].length; j++) {
            if(grid[i][j] != 0) {
                StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
                dfs(grid, i, j, sb, "69"); // origin
                grid[i][j] = 0;
                set.add(sb.toString());
            }
        }
    }
    return set.size();
}
private void dfs(int[][] grid, int i, int j, StringBuilder sb, String dir) {
    if(i < 0 || i == grid.length || j < 0 || j == grid[i].length 
       || grid[i][j] == 0) return;
    sb.append(dir);
    grid[i][j] = 0;
    dfs(grid, i-1, j, sb, "u");
    dfs(grid, i+1, j, sb, "d");
    dfs(grid, i, j-1, sb, "l");
    dfs(grid, i, j+1, sb, "r");
    sb.append("b"); // back
}
}
```
