# 518. Coin Change 2

You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

Return _the number of combinations that make up that amount_. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `0`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

The answer is **guaranteed** to fit into a signed **32-bit** integer.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: amount = 5, coins = [1,2,5]
</strong><strong>Output: 4
</strong><strong>Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
</strong>5=5
5=2+2+1
5=2+1+1+1
5=1+1+1+1+1
</code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]
</strong><strong>Output: 0
</strong><strong>Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 3:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: amount = 10, coins = [10]
</strong><strong>Output: 1
</strong></code></pre>

```
class Solution {
    public int change(int amount, int[] coins) {
        int [] dp = new int[amount+1];
        dp[0] = 1;
        for(int i = 0; i < coins.length; i++)
            for(int j = coins[i]; j <= amount; j++)
                dp[j] = dp[j] + dp[j-coins[i]];
        return dp[amount];
    }
}
```
