# 714. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day, and an integer `fee` representing a transaction fee.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.

**Note:**

* You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
* The transaction fee is only charged once for each stock purchase and sale.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: prices = [1,3,2,8,4,9], fee = 2
</strong><strong>Output: 8
</strong><strong>Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:
</strong>- Buying at prices[0] = 1
- Selling at prices[3] = 8
- Buying at prices[4] = 4
- Selling at prices[5] = 9
The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.
</code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: prices = [1,3,7,5,10,3], fee = 3
</strong><strong>Output: 6
</strong></code></pre>

```
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices, int fee) {
        if(prices.length == 0)
            return 0;
        int[][] dp = new int[prices.length][2];
        dp[0][0] = 0;
        dp[0][1] = -prices[0] - fee;
        
        for(int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++){
            dp[i][0] = Math.max(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][1] + prices[i]);
            dp[i][1] = Math.max(dp[i-1][1], dp[i-1][0] - prices[i] - fee);
        }
        return dp[prices.length - 1][0];         
    }
}
```
