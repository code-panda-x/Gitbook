# 213. House Robber II

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle.** That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return _the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**_.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: nums = [2,3,2]
</strong><strong>Output: 3
</strong><strong>Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
</strong><strong>Output: 4
</strong><strong>Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
</strong>Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
</code></pre>

```
class Solution {
    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        if(nums.length<1) return 0;     
        if(nums.length<2) return nums[0];   
        return Math.max(helper(nums, 0, nums.length-1) ,helper(nums, 1, nums.length));
    }
    public int helper(int[] nums, int l, int r){
        int []dp = new int[nums.length];
        if(l == 0){
            dp[0] = nums[l];
            dp[1] = Math.max(nums[l], nums[l+1]);            
        }
        else
            dp[1] = nums[1];
        
        for(int i = 2; i < r; i++)
            dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i]);
        
        return dp[r-1];
    }
}
```
