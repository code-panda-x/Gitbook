# 200. Number of Islands

Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return _the number of islands_.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: grid = [
</strong>  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
<strong>Output: 1
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: grid = [
</strong>  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
<strong>Output: 3
</strong></code></pre>

可以理解为每一次dfs都是把整块1 （岛屿）变成了0



```java
class Solution {
    int m;
    int n;
    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
        m = grid.length;
        n = grid[0].length;
        int ans = 0;

        for(int i = 0; i < m; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j < n; j++){
                if(grid[i][j] == '1'){
                    dfs(grid, i, j);
                    ans++;
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
    public void dfs(char[][] grid, int i, int j){
        if(i < 0 || i > m-1 || j < 0 || j > n-1 || grid[i][j] != '1')
            return;
        grid[i][j] = '0';
        dfs(grid, i+1, j);
        dfs(grid, i-1, j);
        dfs(grid, i, j+1);
        dfs(grid, i, j-1);
    }
}
```
