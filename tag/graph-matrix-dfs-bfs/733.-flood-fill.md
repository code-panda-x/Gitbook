# 733. Flood Fill

An image is represented by an `m x n` integer grid `image` where `image[i][j]` represents the pixel value of the image.

You are also given three integers `sr`, `sc`, and `color`. You should perform a **flood fill** on the image starting from the pixel `image[sr][sc]`.

To perform a **flood fill**, consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected **4-directionally** to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected **4-directionally** to those pixels (also with the same color), and so on. Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels with `color`.

Return _the modified image after performing the flood fill_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/01/flood1-grid.jpg)

<pre><code><strong>Input: image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]], sr = 1, sc = 1, color = 2
</strong><strong>Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]
</strong><strong>Explanation: From the center of the image with position (sr, sc) = (1, 1) (i.e., the red pixel), all pixels connected by a path of the same color as the starting pixel (i.e., the blue pixels) are colored with the new color.
</strong>Note the bottom corner is not colored 2, because it is not 4-directionally connected to the starting pixel.
</code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: image = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]], sr = 0, sc = 0, color = 0
</strong><strong>Output: [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
</strong><strong>Explanation: The starting pixel is already colored 0, so no changes are made to the image.
</strong></code></pre>

class Solution {
    public int[][] floodFill(int[][] image, int sr, int sc, int newColor) {
        if(image[sr][sc] == newColor)
            return image;
        dfs(image, sr, sc, image[sr][sc], newColor);
        return image;
    }
    public void dfs(int[][] image, int sr, int sc, int color, int newColor){
        if(sr < 0 || sr > image.length - 1 || sc < 0 || sc > image[0].length - 1 || image[sr][sc] != color)
            return;
        image[sr][sc] = newColor;
        
        dfs(image, sr+1, sc, color, newColor);
        dfs(image, sr-1, sc, color, newColor);
        dfs(image, sr, sc+1, color, newColor);
        dfs(image, sr, sc-1, color, newColor);
    }
}
