# 1905. Count Sub Islands

You are given two `m x n` binary matrices `grid1` and `grid2` containing only `0`'s (representing water) and `1`'s (representing land). An **island** is a group of `1`'s connected **4-directionally** (horizontal or vertical). Any cells outside of the grid are considered water cells.

An island in `grid2` is considered a **sub-island** if there is an island in `grid1` that contains **all** the cells that make up **this** island in `grid2`.

Return the _**number** of islands in_ `grid2` _that are considered **sub-islands**_.

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: grid1 = [[1,1,1,0,0],[0,1,1,1,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,0,1,1]], grid2 = [[1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,1,1,1],[0,1,0,0,0],[1,0,1,1,0],[0,1,0,1,0]]
</strong><strong>Output: 3
</strong><strong>Explanation: In the picture above, the grid on the left is grid1 and the grid on the right is grid2.
</strong>The 1s colored red in grid2 are those considered to be part of a sub-island. There are three sub-islands.
</code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: grid1 = [[1,0,1,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1],[1,0,1,0,1]], grid2 = [[0,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1],[0,1,0,1,0],[0,1,0,1,0],[1,0,0,0,1]]
</strong><strong>Output: 2 
</strong><strong>Explanation: In the picture above, the grid on the left is grid1 and the grid on the right is grid2.
</strong>The 1s colored red in grid2 are those considered to be part of a sub-island. There are two sub-islands.
