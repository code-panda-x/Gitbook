# 1020. Number of Enclaves

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid`, where `0` represents a sea cell and `1` represents a land cell.

A **move** consists of walking from one land cell to another adjacent (**4-directionally**) land cell or walking off the boundary of the `grid`.

Return _the number of land cells in_ `grid` _for which we cannot walk off the boundary of the grid in any number of **moves**_.

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0],[1,0,1,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,0]]
</strong><strong>Output: 3
</strong><strong>Explanation: There are three 1s that are enclosed by 0s, and one 1 that is not enclosed because its on the boundary.
</strong></code></pre>
