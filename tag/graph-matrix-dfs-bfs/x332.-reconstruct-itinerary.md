# 332. Reconstruct Itinerary



1. Use `path.addFirst(departure)`: this is called in the end of dfs() method, which means the first one added into the array is the last one it can visit.
2. An Eulerian trail (or Eulerian path) is a trail in a finite graph which visits every edge exactly once.\
   In this case, if you go JFK-->KUL, then there is no edge back, which means you got stuck, then you should go back to JFK and visit NRT first.\
   How to deal with stuck situation:\
   The only possible node that you can get stuck is the end point. If you meet the end point before you finish dfs() method, it will add end point to the path, and then start another recursion.

Addlast是因为当traverse所有vertex后，从后往前回溯，退出recursion，回到初始recursion时，需要不断把自己的parent放到前面

```
public class Solution {

    Map<String, PriorityQueue<String>> flights;
    LinkedList<String> path;

    public List<String> findItinerary(String[][] tickets) {
        flights = new HashMap<>();
        path = new LinkedList<>();
        for (String[] ticket : tickets) {
            flights.putIfAbsent(ticket[0], new PriorityQueue<>());
            flights.get(ticket[0]).add(ticket[1]);
        }
        dfs("JFK");
        return path;
    }

    public void dfs(String departure) {
        PriorityQueue<String> arrivals = flights.get(departure);
        while (arrivals != null && !arrivals.isEmpty())
            dfs(arrivals.poll());
        path.addFirst(departure);
    }
}
```
