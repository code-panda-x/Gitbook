# 523. Continuous Subarray Sum

(a+(n\*x))%x is same as (a%x)

For e.g. in case of the array \[23,2,6,4,7] the running sum is \[23,25,31,35,42] and the remainders are \[5,1,1,5,0]. We got remainder 5 at index 0 and at index 3. That means, in between these two indexes we must have added a number which is multiple of the k. Hope this clarifies your doubt :)

这里store的是index，i-prev > 1 说明有i 和 prev 之间的subarray 是 n\*x，可以被 x 整除

regarding "<0,-1> can allow it to return true when the runningSum%k=0" and "if first element is divisible by k , index -1 will help us not to return true":

For example is \[0,0],0 or \[6,6,1],1; if we put(0,0) instead of put(0,-1), program will wrongly return false. If we don't put anything it still returns false since first 0 will get index 0 and second one will be mapped to index 1, which results to invalid case.

```
class Solution {
    public boolean checkSubarraySum(int[] nums, int k) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>(){{put(0,-1);}};;
        int runningSum = 0;
        for (int i=0;i<nums.length;i++) {
            runningSum = (runningSum + nums[i]) % k;
            Integer prev = map.get(runningSum);
            if (prev != null) {
                if (i - prev > 1) return true;
            }
            else map.put(runningSum, i);
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
