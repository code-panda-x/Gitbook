# 528. Random Pick with Weight

sum是固定的，我们要解决的问题是如何pick an index i with possibility of w\[i]/sum

solution：在prefix sum里用bs找，因为w\[i]越大，从w\[i] 到 w\[i+1]的距离就越长。prefixsum里每个w\[i]之间的距离是按照weight分布的，所以在prefix里面找一个random idx 符合题目要求（possibility of w\[i]/sum）

For those who might still be confused, here is my understanding of how it works, in the solution we are actually using the width of each range as the weight of the indexes (accumulated sum increases more with a higher weight), for example, for index 1 the range is \[3, 7] which is longer than other ranges (since it has higher weight, 5), and therefore the random pick falls into that range with higher probability.

class Solution {

    Random random;
    int[] wSums;
    
    public Solution(int[] w) {
        this.random = new Random();
        for(int i=1; i<w.length; ++i)
            w[i] += w[i-1];
        this.wSums = w;
    }
    
    public int pickIndex() {
        int len = wSums.length;
        int idx = random.nextInt(wSums[len-1]) + 1;
        int left = 0, right = len - 1;
        // search position 
        while(left < right){
            int mid = left + (right-left)/2;
            if(wSums[mid] == idx)
                return mid;
            else if(wSums[mid] < idx)
                left = mid + 1;
            else
                right = mid;
        }
        return left;
    }
}
```
