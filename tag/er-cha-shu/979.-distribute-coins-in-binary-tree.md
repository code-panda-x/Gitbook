# 979. Distribute Coins in Binary Tree

We traverse childs first (post-order traversal), and return the ballance of coins. For example, if we get '+3' from the left child, that means that the left subtree has 3 extra coins to move out. If we get '-1' from the right child, we need to move 1 coin in. So, we increase the number of moves by 4 (3 moves out left + 1 moves in right). We then return the final ballance: r->val (coins in the root) + 3 (left) + (-1) (right) - 1 (keep one coin for the root).\

class Solution {
    int sum = 0;
    public int distributeCoins(TreeNode root) {
        helper(root);
        return sum;
    }
    public int helper(TreeNode root){
        if(root == null)
            return 0;
        int left = helper(root.left);
        int right = helper(root.right);
        sum += Math.abs(left) + Math.abs(right);
        
        return root.val + left + right - 1;
    }
}
