# 424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement

In case anyone is confused by this solution, here's another way of explaining it:

`end-start+1` = size of the current window\
`maxCount` = largest count of a single, unique character in the current window

The main equation is: `end-start+1-maxCount`

When `end-start+1-maxCount` == 0, then then the window is filled with only one character\
When `end-start+1-maxCount` > 0, then we have characters in the window that are NOT the character that occurs the most. `end-start+1-maxCount` is equal to exactly the # of characters that are NOT the character that occurs the most in that window. Example: For a window "xxxyz", `end-start+1-maxCount` would equal 2. (maxCount is 3 and there are 2 characters here, "y" and "z" that are not "x" in the window.)

We are allowed to have at most k replacements in the window, so when `end-start+1-maxCount > k`, then there are more characters in the window than we can replace, and we need to shrink the window.

If we have window with "xxxy" and k = 1, that's fine because `end-start+1-maxCount` = 1, which is not > k. maxLength gets updated to 4.

But if we then find a "z" after, like "xxxyz", then we need to shrink the window because now `end-start+1-maxCount` = 2, and 2 > 1. The window becomes "xxyz".

**`maxCount` may be invalid at some points, but this doesn't matter, because it was valid earlier in the string, and all that matters is finding the max window that occurred **_**anywhere**_** in the string**. Additionally, it will expand _**if and only if**_ enough repeating characters appear in the window to make it expand. So whenever it expands, it's a valid expansion.



一句话解释：

end - start + 1(当前窗口) - maxCount(当前窗口内不需要replace的char的#) = 能repace 的次数

maxCount取freq最高的char因为这样我们就可以以最少的数量k replace得到最长的string

```
class Solution {
    public int characterReplacement(String s, int k) {
        int len = s.length();
        int[] count = new int[26];
        int start = 0, end = 0, maxCount = 0, maxLength = 0;
        while(end < len){
            maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, ++count[s.charAt(end) - 'A']);
            while (end - start + 1 - maxCount > k) {
                count[s.charAt(start) - 'A']--;
                start++;
            }
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, end - start + 1);
            end++;
        }
        return maxLength;
    }
}
```
