# 424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most `k` times.

Return _the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations_.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
</strong><strong>Output: 4
</strong><strong>Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
</strong><strong>Output: 4
</strong><strong>Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
</strong>The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
There may exists other ways to achive this answer too.

In case anyone is confused by this solution, here's another way of explaining it:

`end-start+1` = size of the current window\
`maxCount` = largest count of a single, unique character in the current window

The main equation is: `end-start+1-maxCount`

When `end-start+1-maxCount` == 0, then then the window is filled with only one character\
When `end-start+1-maxCount` > 0, then we have characters in the window that are NOT the character that occurs the most. `end-start+1-maxCount` is equal to exactly the # of characters that are NOT the character that occurs the most in that window. Example: For a window "xxxyz", `end-start+1-maxCount` would equal 2. (maxCount is 3 and there are 2 characters here, "y" and "z" that are not "x" in the window.)

We are allowed to have at most k replacements in the window, so when `end-start+1-maxCount > k`, then there are more characters in the window than we can replace, and we need to shrink the window.

If we have window with "xxxy" and k = 1, that's fine because `end-start+1-maxCount` = 1, which is not > k. maxLength gets updated to 4.

But if we then find a "z" after, like "xxxyz", then we need to shrink the window because now `end-start+1-maxCount` = 2, and 2 > 1. The window becomes "xxyz".

**`maxCount` may be invalid at some points, but this doesn't matter, because it was valid earlier in the string, and all that matters is finding the max window that occurred **_**anywhere**_** in the string**. Additionally, it will expand _**if and only if**_ enough repeating characters appear in the window to make it expand. So whenever it expands, it's a valid expansion.



一句话解释：

end - start + 1(当前窗口) - maxCount(当前窗口内不需要replace的char的#) = 能repace 的次数

maxCount取freq最高的char因为这样我们就可以以最少的数量k replace得到最长的string

```
class Solution {
    public int characterReplacement(String s, int k) {
        int len = s.length();
        int[] count = new int[26];
        int start = 0, end = 0, maxCount = 0, maxLength = 0;
        while(end < len){
            maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, ++count[s.charAt(end) - 'A']);
            while (end - start + 1 - maxCount > k) {
                count[s.charAt(start) - 'A']--;
                start++;
            }
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, end - start + 1);
            end++;
        }
        return maxLength;
    }
}
```
