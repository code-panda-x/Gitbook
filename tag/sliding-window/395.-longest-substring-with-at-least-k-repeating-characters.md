# 395. Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, return _the length of the longest substring of_ `s` _such that the frequency of each character in this substring is greater than or equal to_ `k`.

if no such substring exists, return 0.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: s = "aaabb", k = 3
</strong><strong>Output: 3
</strong><strong>Explanation: The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: s = "ababbc", k = 2
</strong><strong>Output: 5
</strong><strong>Explanation: The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.
</strong></code></pre>
