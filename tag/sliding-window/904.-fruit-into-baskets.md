# 904. Fruit Into Baskets

You are visiting a farm that has a single row of fruit trees arranged from left to right. The trees are represented by an integer array `fruits` where `fruits[i]` is the **type** of fruit the `ith` tree produces.

You want to collect as much fruit as possible. However, the owner has some strict rules that you must follow:

* You only have **two** baskets, and each basket can only hold a **single type** of fruit. There is no limit on the amount of fruit each basket can hold.
* Starting from any tree of your choice, you must pick **exactly one fruit** from **every** tree (including the start tree) while moving to the right. The picked fruits must fit in one of your baskets.
* Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must stop.

Given the integer array `fruits`, return _the **maximum** number of fruits you can pick_.

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: fruits = [1,2,1]
</strong><strong>Output: 3
</strong><strong>Explanation: We can pick from all 3 trees.
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: fruits = [0,1,2,2]
</strong><strong>Output: 3
</strong><strong>Explanation: We can pick from trees [1,2,2].
</strong>If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [0,1].
</code></pre>

**Example 3:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: fruits = [1,2,3,2,2]
</strong><strong>Output: 4
</strong><strong>Explanation: We can pick from trees [2,3,2,2].
</strong>If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [1,2].
</code></pre>

```java
class Solution {
    public int totalFruit(int[] fruits) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int l = 0, r = 0;
        int max = 0;
        int count = 0;

        while(r < fruits.length){
            map.put(fruits[r], map.getOrDefault(fruits[r], 0) + 1);
            if(map.get(fruits[r]) == 1)
                count++;
            r++;

            while(count > 2){
                map.put(fruits[l], map.getOrDefault(fruits[l], 0) - 1);
                if(map.get(fruits[l]) == 0)
                    count--;        
                l++;        
            }
            max = Math.max(max, r-l);
        }
        return max;
    }
}
