# 1838. Frequency of the Most Frequent Element

* Why is the time complexity `O(NlogN)`?\
  The sorting takes `O(NlogN)`. The two pointer part only takes `O(N)` because both the pointers `i` and `j` traverse the array ONLY ONCE.
* Why is `(j - i + 1) * A[j] - sum <= k` valid?\
  `(j - i + 1)` is the length of the window `[i, j]`. We want to increase all the numbers in the window to equal `A[j]`, the number of operations needed is `(j - i + 1) * A[j] - sum` which should be `<= k`. For example, assume the window is `[1,2,3]`, increasing all the numbers to `3` will take `3 * 3 - (1 + 2 + 3)` operations.

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxFrequency(int[] nums, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int l = 0, r = 0, sum = 0, ans = 0;

        while(r < nums.length){
            sum += nums[r];
            while((r - l + 1) * nums[r] > sum + k)
                sum -= nums[l++];
            ans = Math.max(ans, r-l+1);
            r++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
