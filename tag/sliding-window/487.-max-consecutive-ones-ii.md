# 487. Max Consecutive Ones II

Given a binary array `nums`, return _the maximum number of consecutive_ `1`_'s in the array if you can flip at most one_ `0`.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0]
</strong><strong>Output: 4
</strong><strong>Explanation: 
</strong>- If we flip the first zero, nums becomes [1,1,1,1,0] and we have 4 consecutive ones.
- If we flip the second zero, nums becomes [1,0,1,1,1] and we have 3 consecutive ones.
The max number of consecutive ones is 4.
</code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
</strong><strong>Output: 4
</strong><strong>Explanation: 
</strong>- If we flip the first zero, nums becomes [1,1,1,1,0,1] and we have 4 consecutive ones.
- If we flip the second zero, nums becomes [1,0,1,1,1,1] and we have 4 consecutive ones.
The max number of consecutive ones is 4.
</code></pre>

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(int[] A) {
        if(A.length == 0)
            return 0;
        int l = 0, r = 0, res = 0, count = 0;
        while(r < A.length){
            if(A[r++] == 0)
                count++;
            while(count > 1){
                if(A[l++] == 0)
                    count--;
            }
            res = Math.max(res, r - l);
        }
        
        return res;    
    }
}
```
