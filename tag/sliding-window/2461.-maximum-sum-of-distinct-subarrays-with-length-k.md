# 2461. Maximum Sum of Distinct Subarrays With Length K

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. Find the maximum subarray sum of all the subarrays of `nums` that meet the following conditions:

* The length of the subarray is `k`, and
* All the elements of the subarray are **distinct**.

Return _the maximum subarray sum of all the subarrays that meet the conditions._ If no subarray meets the conditions, return `0`.

_A **subarray** is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array._

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: nums = [1,5,4,2,9,9,9], k = 3
</strong><strong>Output: 15
</strong><strong>Explanation: The subarrays of nums with length 3 are:
</strong>- [1,5,4] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 10.
- [5,4,2] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 11.
- [4,2,9] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 15.
- [2,9,9] which does not meet the requirements because the element 9 is repeated.
- [9,9,9] which does not meet the requirements because the element 9 is repeated.
We return 15 because it is the maximum subarray sum of all the subarrays that meet the conditions
</code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: nums = [4,4,4], k = 3
</strong><strong>Output: 0
</strong><strong>Explanation: The subarrays of nums with length 3 are:
</strong>- [4,4,4] which does not meet the requirements because the element 4 is repeated.
We return 0 because no subarrays meet the conditions.
</code></pre>

```java
class Solution {
    public long maximumSubarraySum(int[] nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.length;
		int start = 0, end = 0;
		Long sum = 0l, max = 0l;
		Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
		while (end < n) {
			int val = nums[end];
			while (set.contains(val) || (end - start + 1 > k) && start < end) {
				sum -= nums[start];
				set.remove(nums[start++]);
			}
			sum += val;
			set.add(val);
			if (end - start + 1 == k)
				max = Math.max(max, sum);
			end++;
		}
		return max;
    }
}
