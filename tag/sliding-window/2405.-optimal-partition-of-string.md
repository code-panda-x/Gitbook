# 2405. Optimal Partition of String

Given a string `s`, partition the string into one or more **substrings** such that the characters in each substring are **unique**. That is, no letter appears in a single substring more than **once**.

Return _the **minimum** number of substrings in such a partition._

Note that each character should belong to exactly one substring in a partition.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: s = "abacaba"
</strong><strong>Output: 4
</strong><strong>Explanation:
</strong>Two possible partitions are ("a","ba","cab","a") and ("ab","a","ca","ba").
It can be shown that 4 is the minimum number of substrings needed.
</code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: s = "ssssss"
</strong><strong>Output: 6
</strong><strong>Explanation:
</strong>The only valid partition is ("s","s","s","s","s","s").
</code></pre>
