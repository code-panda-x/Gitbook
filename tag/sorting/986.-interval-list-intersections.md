# 986. Interval List Intersections

You are given two lists of closed intervals, `firstList` and `secondList`, where `firstList[i] = [starti, endi]` and `secondList[j] = [startj, endj]`. Each list of intervals is pairwise **disjoint** and in **sorted order**.

Return _the intersection of these two interval lists_.

A **closed interval** `[a, b]` (with `a <= b`) denotes the set of real numbers `x` with `a <= x <= b`.

The **intersection** of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that are either empty or represented as a closed interval. For example, the intersection of `[1, 3]` and `[2, 4]` is `[2, 3]`.

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: firstList = [[0,2],[5,10],[13,23],[24,25]], secondList = [[1,5],[8,12],[15,24],[25,26]]
</strong><strong>Output: [[1,2],[5,5],[8,10],[15,23],[24,24],[25,25]]
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: firstList = [[1,3],[5,9]], secondList = []
</strong><strong>Output: []
</strong></code></pre>

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] intervalIntersection(int[][] firstList, int[][] secondList) {
        if(firstList.length==0 || secondList.length==0) return new int[0][0];
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        int startMax = 0, endMin = 0;
        List<int[]> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        
        while(i<firstList.length && j<secondList.length){
            startMax = Math.max(firstList[i][0],secondList[j][0]);
            endMin = Math.min(firstList[i][1],secondList[j][1]);
            
			//you have end greater than start and you already know that this interval is sorrounded with startMin and endMax so this must be the intersection
			if(endMin>=startMax){           
                ans.add(new int[]{startMax,endMin});
            }
            
			//the interval with min end has been covered completely and have no chance to intersect with any other interval so move that list's pointer
            if(endMin == firstList[i][1]) i++;       
            if(endMin == secondList[j][1]) j++;
        }
        
        return ans.toArray(new int[ans.size()][2]);
    }
}
```
