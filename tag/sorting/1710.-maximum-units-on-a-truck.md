# 1710. Maximum Units on a Truck

You are assigned to put some amount of boxes onto **one truck**. You are given a 2D array `boxTypes`, where `boxTypes[i] = [numberOfBoxesi, numberOfUnitsPerBoxi]`:

* `numberOfBoxesi` is the number of boxes of type `i`.
* `numberOfUnitsPerBoxi` is the number of units in each box of the type `i`.

You are also given an integer `truckSize`, which is the **maximum** number of **boxes** that can be put on the truck. You can choose any boxes to put on the truck as long as the number of boxes does not exceed `truckSize`.

Return _the **maximum** total number of **units** that can be put on the truck._

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: boxTypes = [[1,3],[2,2],[3,1]], truckSize = 4
</strong><strong>Output: 8
</strong><strong>Explanation: There are:
</strong>- 1 box of the first type that contains 3 units.
- 2 boxes of the second type that contain 2 units each.
- 3 boxes of the third type that contain 1 unit each.
You can take all the boxes of the first and second types, and one box of the third type.
The total number of units will be = (1 * 3) + (2 * 2) + (1 * 1) = 8.
</code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: boxTypes = [[5,10],[2,5],[4,7],[3,9]], truckSize = 10
</strong><strong>Output: 91
</strong></code></pre>

```
class Solution {
    public int maximumUnits(int[][] boxTypes, int truckSize) {
        Arrays.sort(boxTypes, (a,b) -> (a[1] == b[1] ? b[0] - a[0] : b[1] - a[1]));
        // Arrays.sort(boxTypes, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(b[1], a[1]));
        int sum = 0;
        for(int[] box : boxTypes){
            if(box[0] <= truckSize){
                sum += box[0] * box[1];
                truckSize -= box[0];
            }
            else{
                sum += truckSize * box[1];
                break;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
