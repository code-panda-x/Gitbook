# 881. Boats to Save People

&#x20;this will work because&#x20;

1. people's weight <= weight
2. we are adding up weight as long as we can (greedy), which gives us min # of boats

```
class Solution {
    public int numRescueBoats(int[] people, int limit) {
        Arrays.sort(people);
        int l = 0;
        int r = people.length - 1;
        int res = 0;
        while(l <= r){
        // 这一步说明boat可以装当前l和r，我们用了l，l可以move forward
            if(people[l] + people[r] <= limit)
                l++;
            r--;
            res++;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
