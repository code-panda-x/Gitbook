# 881. Boats to Save People

<pre><code><strong>Input: people = [3,2,2,1], limit = 3
</strong><strong>Output: 3
</strong><strong>Explanation: 3 boats (1, 2), (2) and (3)
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: people = [1,2], limit = 3
</strong><strong>Output: 1
</strong><strong>Explanation: 1 boat (1, 2)
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 1:**

&#x20;

Return _the minimum number of boats to carry every given person_.

You are given an array `people` where `people[i]` is the weight of the `ith` person, and an **infinite number of boats** where each boat can carry a maximum weight of `limit`. Each boat carries at most two people at the same time, provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most `limit`.

&#x20;

this will work because&#x20;

1. people's weight <= weight
2. we are adding up weight as long as we can (greedy), which gives us min # of boats

```
class Solution {
    public int numRescueBoats(int[] people, int limit) {
        Arrays.sort(people);
        int l = 0;
        int r = people.length - 1;
        int res = 0;
        while(l <= r){
        // 这一步说明boat可以装当前l和r，我们用了l，l可以move forward
            if(people[l] + people[r] <= limit)
                l++;
            r--;
            res++;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
