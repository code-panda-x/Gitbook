# 23. Merge k Sorted Lists

Yes, queue size will be always list.size() or less (i.e if 3 lists were sent as parameter then queue will be holding 3 nodes after first for loop) . But queue size will never be more than K , because we poll a node before we add another and we just add one node during each iteration.\
Ex:\
\[\
1->4->5,\
1->3->4,\
2->6\
]

After first FOR loop, queue will contain 1,1,2.

Now in the while loop, 1 (1st list) will be removed from queue and we test 1.next!=null and add 4 to the queue. so after 1st iteration queue will be 1,2,4.

In the 2nd iteration, 1 ( 2nd list) will be removed from queue and test 1.next!=null (1.next is 3), add 3 to the queue. So queue will be 2,3,4 after this iteration and this continues, so the size of queue will always be <=K.

```
class Solution {    
    public ListNode mergeKLists(ListNode[] lists) {     
        if( lists == null || lists.length == 0)
            return null;
        PriorityQueue<ListNode> queue = new PriorityQueue<>(lists.length,(a,b) -> a.val-b.val);
        
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode cur = dummy;
        
        for(ListNode node : lists)
        {
            if(node != null)
                queue.offer(node);
        }

        while(!queue.isEmpty())
        {
            cur.next = queue.poll();
            cur = cur.next;
            
            if(cur.next != null)
                queue.offer(cur.next);
        }
        return dummy.next;
}}
```
