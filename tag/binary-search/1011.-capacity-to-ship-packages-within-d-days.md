# 1011. Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days

其实是left bound 问题，因为else 包括了<=

explain low bound high bound:



1. Recognize that we can bound the solution space: lowest bound for the solution is the max weight of an individual container (10). In this case, we can use a day to ship each container, and that is the guaranteed to give us the largest amount of days needed to ship all the containers. The highest bound for the solution is the sum of all the individual weights (55): if you used this weight, you can ship ALL the containers in a day

```
class Solution {
    public int shipWithinDays(int[] weights, int D) {
        int left = 0, right = 0;
        for (int w: weights) {
            left = Math.max(left, w);
            right += w;
        }
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = (left + right) / 2, need = 1, cur = 0;
            for (int w: weights) {
                if (cur + w > mid) {
                    need += 1;
                    cur = 0;
                }
                cur += w;
            }
            if (need > D) left = mid + 1;
            else right = mid - 1;
        }
        return left;
    }
}
```
