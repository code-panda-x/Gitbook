# 1539. Kth Missing Positive Number

抽象

we know it starts from 1, so

```
arr[mid] - (mid + 1)
```

will be the count of number that missed.



本质上还是left bound

不要多想，transform问题：Kth missing positive integer == find a int that it has k missed int before it

```
class Solution {
    public int findKthPositive(int[] arr, int k) {
        int l = 0, r = arr.length - 1;
        while (l <= r) {
            int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
            if (arr[mid] - (mid + 1) >= k) r = mid-1;  //missed more or equal than k numbers, left side;
            else l = mid + 1;   // missed less than k numbers, must be in the right side;
        }
        return l + k;
    }
}

```

why l + k?

Explanation on why l + k:

We use binary search to find the smallest index, `l`, such that there are more than `k` missing numbers in `[0, A[l]]`. The actual number of missing numbers in `[0, A[l-1]]` is `A[l-1] - (l - 1) - 1 = A[l-1] - l`. Counting from `A[l-1]`, The k-th missing number is therefore `(A[l-1] + k - (A[l-1] - l) = l + k`
