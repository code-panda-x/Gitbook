# 1095. Find in Mountain Array

we have to do this because we can't search directly in array, the order is messed up.

By finding the peak, we know the left array of peak is ascending, the right array of peak is descending



```
/**
 * // This is MountainArray's API interface.
 * // You should not implement it, or speculate about its implementation
 * interface MountainArray {
 *     public int get(int index) {}
 *     public int length() {}
 * }
 */
 
class Solution {
    
   public int findInMountainArray(int target, MountainArray A) {
        int n = A.length(), l, r, m, peak = 0;
        // find index of peak
        l  = 0;
        r = n - 1;
        while (l < r) {
            m = (l + r) / 2;
            if (A.get(m) < A.get(m + 1))
                l = peak = m + 1;
            else
                r = m;
        }
        // find target in the left of peak
        l = 0;
        r = peak;
        while (l <= r) {
            m = (l + r) / 2;
            if (A.get(m) < target)
                l = m + 1;
            else if (A.get(m) > target)
                r = m - 1;
            else
                return m;
        }
        // find target in the right of peak
        l = peak;
        r = n - 1;
        while (l <= r) {
            m = (l + r) / 2;
            if (A.get(m) > target)
                l = m + 1;
            else if (A.get(m) < target)
                r = m - 1;
            else
                return m;
        }
        return -1;
    }        
    
}
```
